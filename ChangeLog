Name: Qimen Xu
Changes: (eigenSolver.c)
1. Use eigmin = -2.0 and eigmax = max eigval of -1/2*Lap as initial lower/upper bounds
   for Chebyshev Filtering in the very first SCF step.
2. Created a function for estimating max eigval of the Laplacian operator
   using Lanczos for Dirichlet B.C..

Name: Qimen Xu
Changes: (matVecRoutines.c, initialization.c)
1. Separate out Vnl * vector from Hamiltonian * vector.
2. Use LAPACK for subspace eigenproblem when Nstates <= 2000.

----------------

Name: Qimen Xu
Changes: (nonlocal.c, nonlocal.h)
1. Convert dos/mac newlines to unix format.


----------------
Dec 22, 2018
Name: Qimen Xu
Changes: (eigensolver.c, initialization.c, finalization.c)
1. Provide more workspace for ScaLAPACK eigensolver.
2. Use LAPACK for solving generalized eigenvalue problems
   when Nstates <= 3000.
3. Free D2D targets.


----------------
Dec 20, 2018
Name: Qimen Xu
Changes: (readfiles.c)
1. Correct misspelled flag "EXCHAGE_CORRELATION" to
   "EXCHANGE_CORRELATION". Modify corresponding input test files.


----------------
Dec 16, 2018
Name: Qimen Xu
Changes: (initialization.c, eigensolver)
1. Switch to LAPACK for subspace eigenproblem when Nstates <= 1000.

Name: Qimen Xu, Abhiraj Sharma
Changes: (electronicGroundState.c, eigensolver.c, initialization.c, relax.c)
1. Improve DD2DD. Split DD2DD into three steps: find target, transfer data,
free target object, where finding target is only done once. (by Qimen)
2. Add FIRE algorithm. (by Abhiraj)

----------------
Dec 06, 2018

   k-points are added.


----------------
Nov 25, 2018
Name: Qimen Xu
Changes: (electronicGroundState.c, eigensolver.c, initialization.c)
1. Remove scaling rho to impose the condition int_rho + int_b = 0. This will
   reduce unnecessary global communication time in rho calculation.
2. Use previous minimum eigenvalue as lowerbound for Chebyshev filtering,
   instead of calculating lowerbound using Lanczos in each scf iteration.
3. Disable default pseudopotential filenames and default path.


----------------
Nov 06, 2018

Changes: (finalization.c)
1. Deallocate local and nonlocal influencing atom info. and nonlocal projectors
   in the end of each electronic ground state calculation.

-Date:  05 Nov 2018
-Name:   Qimen, Abhiraj
-changes: Added Dirichlet boundary condition (Qimen) and Molecular dynamics (Abhiraj)



----------------
Oct 30, 2018
Name: Qimen Xu
Changes: (finalization.c)
1. Bug fix: in the case nonlocal influencing atom = 0, the corresponding
			Atom_Influence_nloc arrays are not allocated, thus
			deallocating those arrays will cause error.


----------------
Oct 27, 2018
Name: Qimen Xu
Changes: (electrostatics.c, nonlocal.c)
1. Spherical harmonics formula l = 6, m = 3 fixed, const C6p3 changed.
2. Multiple moment expansion bug: radius (y2) not calculated correctly
   during calculation of the multipole moments Qlm.


----------------
Oct 18, 2018
Name: Qimen Xu
Changes: (electrostatics.c, tools.c)
1. Bug fix: interpolation error when len = 0.
   Sol: return directly if len = 0. (tools.c)
2. Bug fix: error when there's no nonlocal influencing atom in current
            process domain, which will cause a segment fault error.
   Sol: specify influencing n_atom = 0 in such cases. (electrostatics.c)


----------------
Oct 16, 2018
Name: Qimen Xu
Changes: (nonlocal.c, force.c)
1. Bug fix: MKL cblacs_pdgemm error for systems with hydrogen atoms.
   Sol: skip nonlocal component if nproj = 0.
