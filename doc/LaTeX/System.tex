\begin{block}{Description}
The fractional coordinates of atoms of a \hyperlink{ATOM_TYPE}{\texttt{ATOM\_TYPE}} specified before this variable. \texttt{COORD\_FRAC}$(i,j)$ $\times$ \hyperlink{CELL}{\texttt{CELL}}$(j)$, $(j = 1,2,3)$ gives the coordinate of the $i^{th}$ atom along the $j^{th}$ \hyperlink{LATVEC}{\texttt{LATVEC}} direction. If the coordinates are outside the fundamental domain (see \hyperlink{CELL}{\texttt{CELL}} and \hyperlink{LATVEC}{\texttt{LATVEC}}) in the periodic directions (see \hyperlink{BC}{\texttt{BC}}), it will be automatically mapped back to the domain.
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Remark}
For a system with different types of atoms, one has to specify the coordinates for every \hyperlink{ATOM_TYPE}{\texttt{ATOM\_TYPE}}. One can also specify the coordinates of the atoms using \hyperlink{COORD}{\texttt{COORD}}.
