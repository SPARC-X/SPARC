1. Rewrite the nodal Hamiltonian times vector routines
2. Rewrite 3-dimensional arrays into 1-dimensional arrays
3. Test Gauss method for force and stress at both high T (1E6 K) and low T (1E4 K)
4. Remove Cleanshaw-Curtis method for force and stress
5. Optimize the code to get around 1.5 ~ 2 times speedup compared to previous version
